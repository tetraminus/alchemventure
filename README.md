# Alchemy metroidvania





## Theme
"Sixty years ago, Mount Darauris was mined for its rich resources. Today, a dejected alchemist set into the mines to seclude himself from society, ready to die alone. Many years of failed experiments has set him in a bad mood, creating the mentally deranged picture that he became. Explore the lore of the mountain while platforming through massive caves, and learn new magics and potions to propel yourself through the game. You will never be able to explore it all; there isnâ€™t enough time. But you will go as far as you can, learning new and creative solutions to previously impossible obstacles. Just as much as you unlock new abilities, you unlock new knowledge to use to your advantage. But this takes a toll on your mental state. Spending longer and longer in the cave means facing your inner demons, and finally, a monster constructed of your greatest fears."
